    A manufacturing company needs a program that will help its employees
    pack manufactured items into boxes for shipping. Write a Python
    program named boxes.py that asks the user for two integers:  1) the
    number of manufactured items and 2) the number of items that the user
    will pack per box. Your program must compute and print the number of
    boxes necessary to hold the items. This must be a whole number. Note
    that the last box may be packed with fewer items than the other boxes.
