    When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, you
    should maintain your heart rate within a range for at least 20
    minutes. To find that range, subtract your age from 220. This
    difference is your maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart
    simply will not beat faster than this maximum (220 - age).
    When exercising to strengthen your heart, you should keep your
    heart rate between 65% and 85% of your heart’s maximum rate.
